# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder for a value. An argument is what goes into a function to give it an input. I believe a parameter is set into a function to set values for inputs. 

Researched answer: A parameter is listed inside a functions definition. An argument is the actual values listed as inputs for the function. Parameter names are not relevant, what matters is the order of the placeholders (parameters) as the argument that the function inputs returns what is provided in the argument.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The three parameters are current value, the index, and the array that is being called on. I'm not sure which is optional.

Researched answer: The current value is required, while the index, and the array is optional parameters. Value is the parameter that holds the value of the current element being mapped. Index is optional and holds the index of the element provided. Arr is also an optional parameter, and it contains the array. 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .filter is a built-in method that inputs an array and returns a new array with updated values. .map will return an array of the same length

Researched answer: Both are dot notation higher order functions. .map() will transform a new array of the same length. .filter() will filter the array into a new length based on the arguments provided.

4. What is iteration? 

Your answer: Iteration is a function or method performing an action until something is returned.

Researched answer: Iteration is used on arrays, and strings. Iteration will perform tasks until its conditional has been met. It will perform an action for each item, element, or property in a collection of data. 

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: An object is a value within a class. A class holds many objects.

Researched answer: An object is a collection of data. They may hold variables, or functions within them. A class is considered the blueprint for an object, they are a function that contains data, and logic. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting in JavaScript is using a variable before it has been declared, not necessarily reading the code from top to bottom.

Researched answer: Hoisting is a default behavior from JavaScript. It grants the ability for variables to be used before they are declared (in the code block), just as a variable can be declared after being used. This moves all declarations of variables to the top of the current function. (scope)

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: A user story is a explanation of your website or software from the viewpoint from the user's end. Usually informal, and a general explanation. This will help detail how your app will be useful for a customer.

2. Spread operator: The spread operator enables the ability to copy a part, or entirety of an array or object, allowing us to reuse it.

3. React state: React state, is a variable within react that allows us to store data that provides logic in how a component() behaves, and renders. There are two type of components: logic components, and display components.

4. React props: Props is shrortened from properties. This allows us access to pass data, and logic from a component, to a nested component using component calls. Props can be static data, or hold methods. State and props are similar to how function and arguments are related.

5. DOM events: Any interaction that a user has with an app, such as clicking, hovering, or typing, is consider a DOM event. The Document Object Model is always looking for changes.
